Random bits and pieces of coding.

KillStartupChine.sh
    OSX has this annoying startup sound that tends to mess with me whenever I'm
    studying some place quiet. Run this script once, then press 1 to create mute
    on and off scripts. Those scripts are then set as login and logout hooks.
    This script uses OS X's behavior to remember the last volume before shutdown
    as the startup volume. Mute before shutdown and the annoying startup chime
    has been killed! To undo simply run the script using option 2.

autoUpdate.sh

genericBackup.sh
